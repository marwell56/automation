* Pierazzo et al. (2005), Starting conditions for hydrothermal systems underneath Martian craters: Hydrocode modeling,
* 	   GSA Special Paper 384, p443--459.
*         -- Note: Evap = 1.1E11 erg/g (c.f. 1.1E7 J/g in paper)
*                 D3   = 5E10   (units for this are dyne/cm2 not GPa as in paper)
*                 RotDOF, VibDOF, Rbond = 0. (I assume this has the same effect as Rbond = IntDOF = 0 in old ANEOS)
*         -- The solid-solid phase transition at 5 GPa as prescibed here seems to cause strange artefacts in simulations,
*            so I am changing the transition to 20 GPa (and 3.9 g/cc) for now (GSC, 02/2013)

*
*   Explanation of new input parameters for molecular clusters:
*
*   There are 8 new input parameters that appear on line ANEOS6 and ANEOS7 in the space
*   Sam Thompson originally alloted for extensions.  You must use the LONG 
*   input format to access this new data.
*
*
*   Atoms is the number of atoms in the molecular cluster.  If Atoms = 0 or 1
*          no molecular clusters are added.  The current code can treat both
*          Atoms = 2 (diatomic) or Atoms = 3 (triatomic) clusters.
*
*   Ebind is the binding energy of the molecules in eV.
*
*   RotDOF is the number of rotational degrees of freedom in the molecule.  It is 2 for.
*          a diatomic molecule.  Larger values increase the heat capacity of the molecular gas.
*
*   Rbond is the bond length of the clusters in cm.  This is needed to compute
*         the moment of inertia (hence rotational energy level spacing) of the molecules.
*
*   VibDOF is the number of vibrational degrees of freedom.  It is 1 for diatomic molecules,
*          but larger values apply to polyatomic molecules.
*
*  Theta_vib is the effective "debye" temperature of the molecule.  k * Theta_vib is the average
*          spacing of vibrational energy levels.
*
*   flag = 0 uses the standard ANEOS cold pressure equation of state.
*        = 1 substitues a Lennard-Jones cold potential for Pc when eta < 1.
*
*   Pc exp is the exponent of the density ratio in the Lennard-Jones potential
*          for expanded states only. It has no effect on the compressed pressure.
*          use this parameter to move the critical point.
